adapted an example from QE
This example shows how to perform electronic structure calculations
for a system undergoing the presence of a static homogeneous
finite electric field. The method is explained in:

P. Umari and A. Pasquarello, PRL 89,157602 (2002)
I. Souza, J.Iniguez, and D.Vanderbilt, PRL 89, 117602 (2002)

different from QE:
efiled is in unit of Ha/e/bohr in RMG
efiled is in unit of Ry/e/bohr in QE

BerryPhase = "true"
electric_filed = "0.0  0.0  0.001"

Example 1 - dielectric constant of Si

The system is described by a 8-atom cubic unit cell.
We use a regular mesh of 3X3X7 k-points, where we have 7 k-points
along the directions of the electric field

At 0 electric field, Si has a zero dipole, 
The electronic polarization: 8.771126e-04 e/bohr^2

The high-frequency dielectric constant eps_inf is then given by

eps_inf=4*pi*(D[0.001]-D[0.0])/(Efield 0.001) + 1

Hartree = e^2/bohr

eps_inf=12.02 from RMG using sg15 pseudopotential

QE PW/examples/example10: eps_inf = 12.04
