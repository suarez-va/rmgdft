This directory contains RMG input and log files for CO using the all electron
potentials developed by Francois Gygi and described here.

The pseudopotentials are generated internally and may be selected by specifying.

internal_pseudo_type="all_electron"

in the input file. As described in the paper the "hardness" of the pseudopotentials
may be controlled by adjusting a paramter used in their generation. This is controlled
by the input file parameter all_electron_parm as shown below. The default value is 4
with larger values generating a potential which a smaller regularization radius.

all_electron_parm = "4"

Even for a simple molecule such as CO this is a large calculation because dense grids
are required over the entire simulation volume. The equivalent cutoff in a plane wave
calculation would be 12477 Rydbergs. The all electron support in RMG should be considered
experimental and not all features of the code have been tested with it as of Dec 2024.
